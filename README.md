# Package Challenge

This is a plain Java 11 program to compute the number of items to package, to yield a maximum cost/profit.

It uses the Branch and Bound Algorithm and a Decision Tree to pick the final items selected. And returns the result as 
String.

### Requirements

* Java 11 or above
* Maven 3+

### Running the program

This program is designed to be a fully independent jar and can be packaged to generate the corresponding archive as follows

`$ mvn clean package`

#### Cheers !
